**Jina** is cloud-native neural search, powered by the state-of-the-art AI and deep learning. It has **long-term supported** from a full-time, [venture-backed team](https://jina.ai).

## Features

* **Universal Search** - Large-scale indexing and querying of any kind on multiple platforms and architectures. 
* **High Performance** - Scale out your VideoBERT, Xception, word tokenizer, image segmenter, and database to handle billions of data points. Features like async, replicas, and sharding come out-of-the-box.
* **Easy System Engineering** - One-stop solution that frees you from handcrafting and gluing packages, libraries and databases. 
* **Powerful Extensions** - Extensions are just Python scripts or Docker images. [Check out Jina Hub](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-hub) to find out more.

[![We are hiring](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/.github/badges/jina-corp-badge-hiring.svg?raw=true  "We are hiring full-time position at Jina")](https://jobs.jina.ai)
Jina is an open-source project. [We are hiring](https://jobs.jina.ai) AI engineers, full-stack developers, evangelists, and PMs to build the next neural search eco-system in open-source.

## Install [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/jina?color=%23099cec&label=PyPI%20package&logo=pypi&logoColor=white)](https://pypi.org/project/jina/) [![Docker](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/.github/badges/docker-badge.svg?raw=true  "Jina is multi-arch ready, can run on different architectures")](https://hub.docker.com/r/jinaai/jina/tags) [![Docker Image Version (latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/jinaai/jina?color=%23099cec&label=Docker%20Image&logo=docker&logoColor=white&sort=semver)](https://hub.docker.com/r/jinaai/jina/tags)

With pip:

```bash
pip install jina
```

To install Jina with extra dependencies, or install on Raspberry Pi [please refer to the documentation](https://docs.jina.ai).

With Docker:

```bash
docker run jinaai/jina --help
```

## Try it Out

If you installed Jina with `pip`:

```bash
jina hello-world
```

Or if you used Docker:

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd)/j:/j" jinaai/jina hello-world --workdir /j && open j/hello-world.html  # replace "open" with "xdg-open" on Linux
```

The Docker image downloads Fashion-MNIST training and test data and tells Jina to index 60,000 images from the training set. Then it randomly samples images from the test set as queries and asks Jina to retrieve relevant results. The whole process takes about 1 minute, and it'll eventually open a webpage and show results like this:

As for the implementation behind it? It's as simple as can be:

<td> Python API </td>
<td> index.yml</td>
<td> <a href="https://github.com/jina-ai/dashboard">Flow in Dashboard</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>


```python
from jina.flow import Flow

f = Flow.load_config('index.yml')

with f:

All the big words you can name: computer vision, neural IR, microservice, message queue, elastic, replicas & shards. They all happened in just one minute!

Intrigued? Play with different options:

```bash

## Build your own Project

With [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) you can easily create a Jina project from templates with one terminal command. This creates a Python entrypoint, YAML configs and a Dockerfile. You can start from there.

```bash
pip install cookiecutter && cookiecutter gh:jina-ai/cookiecutter-jina
```
